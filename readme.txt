The purpose of the is app is primarily to learn how to use Python, Flask, 
HTML, CSS, how to interact with a database, and whatever other things I need 
to pick up along the way. I used primarily the Codeacademy lessons on HTML, CSS
Flask, Python, and Corey Schafer's series on Flask.

The game is a simple number guessing game, but it requires a new number
generated for every user as well as a record of guesses.

12/19 I think I have a usable base for the game. I next want 
to focus on figuring how to tie each user to a session and 
initiate/delete tables without create_all/drop_all.

 To play the game, run the run_bagels_app. To see the correct number 
 while playing the game, see line 9 in models.py.
